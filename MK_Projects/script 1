Script for Video Presentation
[Opening]
(0:00 - 0:30)
Hello everyone, my name is [Your Name], and today I want to share my journey with you—a journey of connecting the dots in my career. Like many of you, I've faced challenges and made choices that have shaped my path in ways I could never have imagined.

It all began with my passion for IT. However, due to the high unemployment rate in the tech sector, I decided to pivot and change my major to Business and Finance at Universiti Teknologi Mara. This decision was not easy, but I believed it would open new doors for me.

[Body]
(0:30 - 2:30)
After completing my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at one of Malaysia's Government Linked Companies, Petronas Lubricant. This experience was invaluable, but I felt a strong pull to return to the north region, closer to my hometown, to support my single mother.

Shortly after, I received an invitation to join Citigroup, marking the beginning of my first career journey. It was here that I met my future spouse, a wonderful colleague who became my partner in life.

After three years as a fresh graduate, I transitioned to Thomson Reuters, where I took on a screening job. It was in this role that I identified significant improvements we could implement to save time in our processes. I started suggesting and implementing automation solutions using VBA code, which ultimately saved our team over 1,000 hours a year. This was my first dot connected—realizing that my passion for IT could enhance efficiency in the business world.

Recognizing my contributions, the Director of the PMT team invited me to join their team as an in-house developer, providing automation support. For the next three years, I thrived as a junior software developer, completing numerous automation projects using Salesforce as our CRM. I even earned my first certification as a Salesforce Platform App Builder.

Today, I'm thrilled to share that I've been pulled into one of the TECH teams at LSEG, where I work on exciting projects involving remote collaboration and automation using Python. I’m also exploring the use of large language models for our projects, expanding my skill set beyond just Salesforce.

[Closing]
(2:30 - 3:00)
As I reflect on my journey, I see how each experience has connected the dots to lead me to where I am today. I love what I do, and I am grateful for every challenge and opportunity that has come my way.

Remember, sometimes the paths we take may not seem linear, but they all contribute to our growth and success. Thank you for listening, and I hope my story inspires you to embrace your own journey and connect your dots.

Feel free to modify any parts of the script to better match your style or add any personal touches. Good luck with your presentation
